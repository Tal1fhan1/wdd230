        Overview
        </p>
        <p>
            The home page will have a basic overview of what Shonen anime is and where it came from. It will explain
            that Shonen anime is adapted from manga (Japanese comics) that have been released by a company called Shonen
            Jump
        </p>
        <p>
        <div class="title"></div>
        Target Audience
        </p>
        <p>
            The main target audience of Shonen is teenagers. There are a lot of shows that feature a teenage protagonist
            or even an entire cast of teenagers. The lessons that can be learned are also usually geared to teenagers
            because they teach principles of self-worth, discipline and determination. These are all essential values to
            have during adolescent due to the fact that most problems that teenagers face are due to a lack of one or
            more of those values.

        <p>

        Genres and Themes
        </p>
        <p>
            Most, if not all, of the shows that fall under the Shonen umbrella are heavily focused on fast paced action.
            That certainly isn't all that there is to it because they also contain elements of other genres sprinkled
            into them like Sci-fi and fantasy. They all have a wide range of themes that they tackle. Some shows focus
            on lighter themes like adventure and friendship. Other shows focus on darker themes such as the
            inevitability of death and futility of life.

        </div>
        <p>
            There is no denying that some of the most popular and iconic characters in all of fiction are from Shonen
            Anime. Characters like Goku, Naruto and Luffy just to name a few who are the dictionary definition of
            iconic. Chances are, even if you don't recognise their names, you have definitely seen what they look like.
            Characters in these shows have been written in such a way that anyone can relate to and empathise with them.
            You get to see them succeed and fail, laugh and cry but most importantly you get to watch them grow and
            develop.

        </div>
        <p>
            The worlds that these shows take place in are all so unique and memorable. Some of them are worlds that we
            wish we could live in and some of them we would not want to step foot in. Either way they feel real because
            they have been built from the ground up to be believable. Even though they are not real, these worlds can
            sometimes feel more real than our own which is why people get really attached to them.

            Page 3 will focus on the influence it had on the world. Due to how Shonen anime has become, it has been very
            influential to pop culture and it started many tropes that are still followed to this day.

            Iconic moves.

        </div>
        <p>
            One word: Kamehameha. Even if you have not watched any Shonen anime, you know exactly what that is. That is
            the move that every fan of Dragon Ball has tried to do at least once in their life.

        </div>
        <p>
            There are a lot of shows that include characters that can transform. Some that immediately comes to mind are
            Ben 10 and Danny Phantom. As amazing as those shows are, they probably wouldn't even exist if it wasn't
            inspired by the transformations that were pioneered by shows like Dragon Ball Z. Everyone knows what it
            means to go 'Super Saiyan'. Sometimes it is even used in everyday conversation to describe someone who
            surpassed their limits. It is just that iconic.
